# You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money
# stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system
# connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.
#
# Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount
# of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.
